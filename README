#Intro

This program is decoding, filtering and playing encoded audio streams

#Compilation

To compile it, you need cmake , ffmpeg-dev (>=V3.0.0) and libao-dev installed in /usr/local/

1, clone the project in $PROJECT_DIR
2, Create shallow build directory (ie: mkdir $PROJECT_DIR/build)
3, cd $PROJECT_DIR/build
4, cmake ..
5, make

#Execution 

./Decode_Audio2 ~/musique/some_music.mp4

Please note that only aac streams are supported at the moment.

The filter coefficients were generated with scilab using the equiribble constrain.
The current filter is 63 taps pass-band filter centered between 5 and 10 kHz.
Only floating point is used at the moment.


Filtering is only applied on the left channel.
